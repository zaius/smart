// Find good solution for data length needing to be known before appending headers
	// Try change position stuff to be pointers
Some variables are incorrect sizes / mixed sizes
// SLIP needs some work before it will receive packets
// Some solution to SLIP needing a seperate receive buffer 
// Some solution to half received/incomplete slip packets
	stop allowing disjointed packets?
	Block until a full packet received (would need some sort of timeout)
Find a good source for seeding random numbers
	First incoming packet?
	Seed in eeprom?
IPV6
ICMP ping and ping reply
x Struct memory assignment from pointers with malloc (in main)
// Standard function commenting for automatic doco - doxygen?
	// Move existing comments to doxygen
// Make receiver strip headers and insert into structs
// Dealing with errors (eg. not implemented ICMP codes)
// Logging / debugging messages
// Move all logging stuff to be a compile time option
Make sure malloc memory is being correctly freed
// Drop IP packets not addressed to this IP
// Find a good way to deal with broadcast packets
// Put into SVN repository



Things I want after assessment:
Programming over the network
Zigbee
Restructure the whole file layout and making process to make things nice
Use timers to periodically call events
Random IP addresses / dhcp
Security - physically transmit shared keys between devices?
IPv6
ICMP
Maybe TCP?
Webpage
Change all possible run time stuff to compile time
